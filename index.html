    <div class="docs-section" id="about">
      <h6 class="docs-header">About Nick</h6>
      <p>I am a 4th year student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science. I was born in Miami and I lived there
      until I was about 10. Then I moved to Brownsville, TX and went
      to middle school and high school there. After graduated high
      school in 2012, I applied to the University of Texas at Austin.
      I've been living in Austin ever since. I love playing music and
      I'm a member of the UT Pep Band as well as the UT Steel Pan
      Ensemble. I love biking all over Austin. You can usually find
      me biking around town on the weekends with my fiance, Barbara.
      I also love to code, and I made my career out of it.
      <!-- I'm currently learning how to create

      After my changes, any dissertation added to the database automattically displayed without any interaction from the development team.
      I've also helped resolve issues on the projects github page. I contribute to the project by testing and documenting the set up

          <ul>
            <li>
              To redesign the perx.com website, the development team has been working
              on redeploying the site as a django site. I have worked on several bugs
              and introduced new features. The bugs have included fixing CSS so the new site
              is compatible and looks uniform with all major browsers, operating systems, and devices.
              I've implemented the breadcrumbs to ease site navigation for users. I've helped create
              templates by getting data from the REST api and putting it into templates. I've implemented a caching
              system so that typeaheads work faster, this feature got rid of a 5 second round trip time for 
              typeaheads. This site is currently in development.

          <b>Cruise Pricing Importer</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Perx receives pricing feeds from various cruise lines to
              keey their shopping system rates as fresh as possible.
              These pricing feeds don't follow a standard format and
              even change the format sometimes. I wrote a django
              website that can handle different vendor feeds and
              process them according to their format. The site supports
              automated feed importing and manual feed importing. I
              built in a dashboard so that the people that import
              cruise rates can easily see if there are any errors with
              the imports. The feeds that get processed enter rates into
              the pricing database automatically. The site also deletes
              rates in the database and files on the server that are older
              than 5 days. Lastly, old rates can be manually flushed out if needed.

          <b>Roadshow Kiosk</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The marketing department at Perx goes to tradeshows/roadshows
              at airports to get people to sign up for the website.
              Traditionally, they ask people to fill out a paper form
              with their information and then they enter the customer
              info in the customer database manually when they return
              to the office. In order to modernize this process, I
              wrote a flask application that can work completely
              offline (these tradeshows hardly have internet or power
              access). This application was deployed on chromebooks
              that were put in developer mode to cut hardware costs.
              Instead of manually entering the data, now the process
              is automated.

            <ul>
              <li>
                In order to prepare for the launch of the new perx.com
                site, developers needed to know what image assets they
                had to use in the site. I wrote a python script that
                recursively searches a directory and all its
                sub-directories for images. The script outputs image
                metadata like path, dimension, and resolution to a csv
                file so that the developers could get a comprehensive
                snapshot of all the images they have instead of
                manually searching for them.

            <ul>
              <li>
                In order to get a more detailed view of how customers
                will use the new perx.com site, I wrote a django
                middleware that can track user and session metadata.
                Later this information can be used for data
                visualization.

            <ul>
              <li>
                As the paleocore.org website started getting more
                features and needing more dependencies, it became more
                tedious to install all the requirements and make sure
                all the database connections are working whenever
                someone wanted to contribute to the site. I wrote a
                Python script that automated that installation process.
                That way, deploying a new local instance of the
                repository became very easy.

            <ul>

                Every time a new dissertation was added to the
                paleoanthro.org database, someone would go in and
                manually edit the dissertation HTML to reflect the new entry. I wrote a template using the django templating
                language so that the HTML would be automatically
                generated on the fly to reflect all the dissertations
                in the database.
