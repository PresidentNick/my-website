This week was a short but very hectic week. Labor day was last Monday, so we didn't have any class. On Wednesday, Professor Downing brought a guest speaker to talk in the class. Chris Martin
from Bloomberg came in and gave a pretty informative talk about interviews and resumes. So we really only had one day of class, which was Friday. We talked about exceptions on Friday. 
That's not what made this week hectic thought. I attended DjangoCon throughout the week in between classes. I learned a lot of useful things that I can apply to future school and work projects!
I attended a lot of the talks ranging from challenges in teaching Django, to how to model data in your back-end database. Between the chaos of going back and forth
between the AT&T Conference Center and my classes, I also had to work on my figuring out why the cache in my oop program wasn't working. This was mentally blocking me from getting started on
my swe project. After going through several office hours throughout the week, I was finally able to fix it on Thursday around 4pm. This gave me six hours to complete the swe project
that was due on the same day. Fortunately the swe project is the same as the oop project, so I was able to just translate my c++ code into Python and I finished all of the requirements
at 7:30pm on Thursday! I need to learn how to manage my time between the two classes since future projects will not be exactly the same anymore. So I've already started my own advice and
started familiarizing myself with both of the projects by finding videos about them on Youtube and reading articles about it. That way I can go into class tommorrow knowing what is going on.

###Tip of the Week:
When you want to test the front facing side of your web app, consider using [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/). It can help you automate browser testing on your site. It supports 
several browsers!
