This week in class, Professor Downing taught us more about range iterators and lambdas. We practiced doing the implementations of these functions and classes in class. This is mostly 
for preparation of the test coming up this week. I'm not too nervous about it since I'm more fluent in python than I am in c++. So since I have the option to take the software engineering 
exam first before the object oriented one, I will take it so I can have more time to practice writing c++ code. Hopefully that will help me do better on that exam. I'm so glad that I 
didn't have to work on a project this week. It was a nice break that I didn't have to stay after classes to work on it with a partner. This gave me a chance to put in hours in my work. 
I was able to implement a prototype for the mobile app that my boss wants me to create. I released it to the amazon app store since they will be running the app on a fire tablet since 
they're cheap, only $50 each. I was able to put it 9 hours this week which was a good break from working on school projects. I was also able to go to six flags today to take a destresser 
from school. No ACL for me. This coming week though is back to crunch time, as I will preparing for three tests :( hopefully it goes well with this week's tests.

###Tip of the Week:
If you have a router that supports openwrt, you should really consider installing openwrt on it. Then you can run [this](https://gist.github.com/teffalump/7227752) script on it to block 
ads at the router level! This lets you skip ads on devices that don't support adblocking software such as a chromecast. Then you can watch hulu and youtube videos on your chromecast 
without the need to view the ads! Running [this](https://github.com/phiresky/nmap-log-parse) on the router is also really cool. It logs devices that connect to your router and logs their 
uptime.
