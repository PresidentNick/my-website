This week in class, Professor Downing taught us about one my of favorite things about Python (although I'm not sure if this is exlusive to Python). On Monday he taught us about function 
keywords, function defaults, and the *args **kwargs in the function signature. I've used these things before at work, but now I understand how they work better. I feel like I can use this 
better to my advantage that how I was using it before. On Wednesday he talked about Python decorators, and explained something that I had no idea how it worked. Decorators always seemed 
pretty magical to me since I didn't really know exactly what was going on. I've also never written a decorator, just used ones that have been written before. Apparently, they take in your 
function and they change it to manipulate it to what you need it to do. Which is really cool, since I thought they ran every time the fuction is called, but it's like a whole new function 
with the same name takes its place. I studied all day for the test on Thursday after class. I decided to take this test first to give myself more time to study for the oop one in c++. To 
my surprise several of the functions that I practiced writing before the test were on the test itself. The only problem was that I didn't handle multiple arguments when practicing these 
functions. So I had a little trouble trying to remember how to do that from Wednesday's lecture. I tried my best, so I'm sure I'll get some partial credit for that.

###Tip of the Week:
A raspberry pi can make a super cheap personal cloud or personal VPN to your own network, even a light server for your website. [This](http://readwrite.com/2014/06/27/raspberry-pi-web-server-website-hosting) page shows a pretty good explanation on how to use your pi to host.
