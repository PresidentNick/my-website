Once again, I am a late for the blog entry for this week. I had a backlog of blog entries to write. I think I have a pretty justifiable
reason to have forgotten about it though. I got a new miniature australian sheperd puppy last Sunday! So my fiance and I have been taking
care of him for a week already. We named him Tony. So Tony has been taking away most of my free time recently, but I just made a dedicated
effort to write about this past week of software engineering class in my blog. So this past week, has been pretty slow in regards to this
software engineering class. Since we got so much done in the first phase of the project, we didn't really meet a whole lot this week to
work on it as a group. We've been mostly working on it individually. Since the first phase of this project still hasn't been graded (yet
the second phase is due really soon this week), we haven't been able to push code to our project server. To alleviate that issue I spun up
another server which I'll call the dev server which can be updated as many times as we want (we can't push code to our production server
before getting a grade on the first phase). So I just set up the host records in namecheap to direct dev.importmarvel.com to our
development server. I think it was a pretty neat solution given that we can't push to production server.

###Tip of the Week:
your domain can have several A records, just change the host to whatever you need it to be, and namecheap will points your domain to
wherever it needs to go.
