This week in class, Professor Downing explained to us how the 3rd project, the memory allocator, is going to work. On Wednesday, we talked about some array functions. On Friday, we talked 
about function defaults, which are one of my favorite features of a language. I find them very helpful and I use them a lot in the real world, AKA work. My partner and I have started 
working on the allocator alread, but there are some things we still don't understand. So I will go to office hours on Monday to understand better what we have to do. OOP has started 
to become more difficult for me, but only because there are many things about c++ that I don't understand. I think if the class was taught in Python, I would have a much better time 
understanding it. On a brighter note, I got my test score from the test I took last week. I did a lot better than I thought I would. My score was also really close to the class average. 
I though I was going to do better on my swe exam since it was in Python, but that was not the case. A friend of mine asked me for some advice on whether or not to drop the class after 
getting a bad test score. Unfortunately I was not able to give a binary answer, but I suggested going to office hours to talk to professor Downing. Hopefully that can help with making 
a decision.

###Tip of the Week:
When creating a virtual server on rackspace, make sure to secure your environment by not allowing password logins, and using ssh keys to log in. Also disable the root user, and create a 
non-root user for yourself.
