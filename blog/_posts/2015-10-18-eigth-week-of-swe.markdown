This week in class, Professor Downing explained to us how the group project is going to work. We also had a guest speaker from rackspace come in and talk to us about how to set up a 
virtual server. I had already set one up on rackspace, but he mentioned about how to secure a server so it will be harder to gain access. So I deleted the first server and set up another 
one. That gives me good practice anyways, so it wasn't that bad. On Friday, we sort of implemented the algorithm to select sql rows in python to understand how it works in the backend.
I am pretty excited for the final class project we have started our work on. I set up a working skeleton site on our server with flask before our first group meeting. That way, once our 
group had our first meeting on Friday, it was very quick to get started. By knowing most of how to set up the environment and make things work more than the other people in my group 
because of the work I've done for money, I naturally became the leader of the group. I quickly found good assignments to give to my group members, and I think we go a lot of work done 
on our first meeting on Friday. We met again on Sunday and we got a bigger chunk of our website done. I also got my test 1 score from last week. Surprisingly, I did better on my OOP exam, 
than on this one, even though I felt better about this exam last week.

###Tip of the Week:
When creating a virtual server on rackspace, make sure to secure your environment by not allowing password logins, and using ssh keys to log in. Also disable the root user, and create a 
non-root user for yourself.
