This week in class, Professor Downing talked about designing algoritms that can accept the lowest common requirement of a data structure. It's a lot more valuable 
to write a function that can do the same thing to various objects and data structures than to make a specialized function that will only work on a small amount of 
objects and data structures. On Wednesday, there was a guest speaker from JPL, Alex Menzies. He talked about what it's like working as a software developer at JPL. He 
gets to work "on Mars" and get back home everyday at the end of the day. Since I spent most of last week and this week working on the SWE project (I had to finish it 
for sure by Wednesday, since my partner for that project was going out of town for an interview with Microsoft), my partner and I had to cram as much as we could into 
the Australian voting project on Wednesday and Thursday. The biggest frustration about this project was knowing exactly how to solve the problem, but not knowing 
enough about c++ to implement it in that language. I was able to write a python solution for it, which gave us some ideas about how to handle it in c++. Late Thursday 
night we were getting really close to writing the right solution, but we were still getting errors. Thankfully one of the TA's was hanging around the lab late on 
Thursday and he agreed to help us. I am very thankful that he did! Fortunately, we figured out the simple solution, but unfortunately we didn't have time to solve it with 
an optimized solution. On Friday, Professor Downing talked about iterators in c++.

###Tip of the Week:
Most android APKs are compatible with the new Amazon Fire tablet that released. It's only $50, so if you ever need to build or test a project for android and don't 
want to spend too much. The new tablet is a very viable option for this. I suggested it to my boss since he wanted me to develop a mobile app, and he really liked 
the idea.
