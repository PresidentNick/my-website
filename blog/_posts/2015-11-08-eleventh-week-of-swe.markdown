Back to on time blog posts! This week in software engineering was pretty fun. I got to sit back on the administration side of team leading
as someone else what the team leader this time. All I had to do was do what the team leader assigned for me to do. It was great to see
the progress that we'd come along to since we started. One of the greater challenges is still just coming up with all the documentation
for our website. Not really sure how we pulled it off, but we did! Some of the new features of our website include pagination in alll
of the list views for all the models. Also we implemented a better about page, with a nicer table on desktop view. We also fixed the
splash page mobile rendering. We now have our models integrated into our database and that content is being dynamically loaded into the
site templates. One cool thing that we did with our database is that the while the list views are still being served from the source API,
our database models get dynamically loaded. So if a user requests a page that hasn't been visited before, that content will be loaded
into the database from the source API. If a user requests a page that has been requested before, the content will just be loaded directly
from the database. I had an excellent weekend though! Today, my puppy Tony went to meet the people and the dogs he'd be staying with while
my fiance and I are out for Thanksgiving break. He's staying with professor Batory and his two Australian sheperds, Scarlett and Chief.
Tony had a great time playing with them. Although the two dogs were much bigger than he was, he was brave enough to bark at them and run
around.

###Tip of the week:
When taking photos, if you don't mind backing them up to Google, Google will organize and even make new creations of photos and videos
you've taken. Here is one example of a video I didn't cut or edit, all done by the magic of Google. [example](https://goo.gl/photos/isT57xVNQ2xZvnh89)
