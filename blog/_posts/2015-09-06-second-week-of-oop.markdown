This week was the first full week of classes. On Monday I got an email from the registrar letting me know that I had gotten off the waitlist for software engineering. I had forgotten that I 
was on that waitlist. So after I heard from classmates that both classes take up a lot of time, I dropped my probability and statistics class to give myself more time to work on the projects 
of the two classes. I also went to talk to professor Downing on Friday during his office hours. It was a very pleasant talk. He told me about his history and I talked with him about mine. 
Turns out we both have roots in Miami! We're also both going to Miami for Thanksgiving this year. In class this week, professor Downing explained the first project in more detail. Just like 
last week, the professor asked many questions in class by calling out random students for the answers. With those questions he helped us realize two simple optimizations that can be added 
to our projects to make them more efficient. One was if the number you are on when calculating cycle length is odd, you can do two arithmetic steps on them in one go. The other was how to 
determine when we can slash half of the numbers in the range we want to find cycle lengths for. Professor Downing also helped us think about the types of caches that we can use in our 
project. He started leading the way, but he helped by putting the spark in our heads for the overachievers that would want to implement the best caches.

###Tip of the Week:
Microsoft Azure is not only for microsoft and .net, it can also be a good platform to deploy your web app since it supports many frameworks.
