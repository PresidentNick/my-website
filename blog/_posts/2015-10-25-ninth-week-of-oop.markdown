So sorry, I totally forgot about my blog with everything that has been going along recently. So, two weeks ago my partner and were
frantically trying to complete the allocator project on Thursday. Thankfully we finished it and turned it in time with enough time
to let me meet with my software engineering group to finish up the first phase of our website and turn it in. Unfortunately, we
forgot to confirm that the graders had been added to our allocator repository. So we ended up losing 20% of our grade after turning it in
a day late. I really think the project shouldn't have been docked that big of a percentage for forgetting something so small. It's not
like we didn't do the project. I added the graders to the project just as soon as I received the email. It wasn't even the next day I
believe. For class itself, professor Downing explained to us how we would create a vector class in c++. Class is starting to get much
harder for me to understand. I think it's cause I'm mostly focusing more of my time on the software engineering project. I think that
that is because I am more comfortable working in Python and flask. As I have mentioned before in my previous posts. I've worked with
several flask projects at my actual job so I was able to bootstrap the project. I need to focus more of my efforts in object oriented
programming though so I will be able to do well in the last part of the class.

###Tip of the Week:
raspberry pis can take pictures with any type of webcam, not just the one designed for raspberry pi. if you want to set up a simple
webcam website, you should check out my implementation of my puppy cam [here](https://github.com/shibehacker/shibehacker.github.io)
