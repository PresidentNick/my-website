Back to on time blog posts! This week in class was tough. My partner and I didn't get much traction in our Darwin project. We realized
too late that we had to write an iterator for our Darwin class, and we weren't exactly sure how to proceed in doing that. We debated
whether we should make the container for our game board a 2D vector or just a 1D vector and returning the modded output to determine
what row we were on. The 1D vector was a little more simpler to write an iterator for since we could just use vector's iterator to
traverse the darwin game board. Changing to a 1D vector as our container meant refactoring most of our code to be able to work with
that 1D vector. We were already running tight on time, so we decided not to refactor all of our code. Instead we opted to trying to
figure out how we'd write this iterator for it to work with our 2D vector game board. Unfortunately after many tries, we weren't
exactly able to figure that out. We ended up turning in incomplete work a day late. It was not a fun week :( I had an excellent
weekend though! Today, my puppy Tony went to meet the people and the dogs he'd be staying with while my fiance and I are out for
Thanksgiving break. He's staying with professor Batory and his two Australian sheperds, Scarlett and Chief. Tony had a great time
playing with them. Although the two dogs were much bigger than he was, he was brave enough to bark at them and run around.

###Tip of the week:
When taking photos, if you don't mind backing them up to Google, Google will organize and even make new creations of photos and videos
you've taken. Here is one example of a video I didn't cut or edit, all done by the magic of Google. [example](https://goo.gl/photos/isT57xVNQ2xZvnh89)
