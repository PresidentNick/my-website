This week in class, Professor Downing showed us the value of not reinventing the wheel. He made us implement several numpy 
functions ourselves and he showed us the runtimes of those implemented functions. The ones that were rewritten were a lot slower
than the ones used from numpy. He also explained how map and reduce work in python. Those two insights this week were pretty 
helpful in implementing a solution for the Netlix algorithm. This is my first software engineering project that I can work with
a partner. I partnered up with [Erick Cardenas](http://ercardenas.github.io/) for this one. I've worked with him before since
we both worked for the CS Department in the purchasing office. We started the project already and have made really good progress. 
We've already taken care of the IO part of the project. We've implemented a simple solution that gets our RSME down to 0.97. 
This is where we're stuck since we're not sure how we can improve it. The things we've tried so far have only made our RSME higher 
than 0.97. We will go to office hours tomorrow to talk to Professor Downing to see what strategies we could possibly use to get a 
lower RSME. Also, tomorrow is career fair. Professor Downing has talked a lot about it and highly emphasizes going to it. I'll 
print some resumes out tomorrow. I'm hoping it'll go well. I already have a really good job and it can only get better from here.

###Tip of the Week:
See if your router supports [openwrt](https://openwrt.org/). It pratically turns your router into a linux machine and adds a whole 
bunch of cool functionality to it! This weekend I put an program that tracks connections to my router and graphs the data to 
a webpage. I didn't actually write it myself, [this](https://github.com/phiresky/nmap-log-parse) is the author. It was a fun 
little project to get running on my router. Now I can see these graphs whenever I want!
