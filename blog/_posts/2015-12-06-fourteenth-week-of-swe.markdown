After such a hectic last week of school, it's finally over. Professor Downing's software engineering class was one of the most fun I've taken at UTCS. I really
enjoyed getting to work with a group to see our website come to life. I would highly recommend software engineering for anyone that wants to learn about
web application frameworks in a group setting. The only word of caution though is that the lectures won't really be very useful for any of the website development
as professor downing doesn't go over any relevant material, not even best practices for setting up your website in the framework that is chosen for the semester.
All of that information would be found on his site as links to places where you can learn it. So if you need for that kind of stuff to be taught to you in person,
I would not recommend this class. I would also not recommend this class if you don't like to work in a large group (5-6 people) since for the most part, that
is what you'll be working with.

###Tip of the week:
When writing code into a text entry box on Canvas, you should select the `preformatted text` styling for the code, that way it is easier to type and read `since
it will look like this`
