This week in class, Professor Downing talked about the reduce method on Monday. On Wednesday, there was a guest speaker from JPL, Alex Menzies. He talked about what it's 
like working as a software developer at JPL. He gets to work "on Mars" and get back home everyday at the end of the day. I didn't actually attend this lecture in software 
engineering because I had already heard it in my oop class the hour before. This gave me a great opportunity to meet with my project partner from oop to finished the 
Australian voting project. This week was a little rougher in terms of projects from the first two weeks in swe and oop. The second project in both classes were not the 
same as each other. So I had to devote a lot more time to coding the Netflix project. The good thing is that since I got a partner for this project I was able to get 
things done a lot more quickly. We were able to get our RMSE below 1.0 pretty quickly in the development process. What bugged us the most though is that no matter how 
hard we tried within the alloted time, no changed the the rating calculation helped us get our RMSE below .95. That is the RMSE that we needed to get bonus points. In 
the end we settled for .97 and were able to finish it on Wednesday. On Friday, Professor Downing talked about iterators in Python. It was very similar to the Friday 
lecture in oop.

###Tip of the Week:
Most android APKs are compatible with the new Amazon Fire tablet that released. It's only $50, so if you ever need to build or test a project for android and don't 
want to spend too much. The new tablet is a very viable option for this. I suggested it to my boss since he wanted me to develop a mobile app, and he really liked 
the idea.
