This first week of class wasn't to bad considering that it was a short week. After finding out that I will get extra credit in my OOP class for writing a blog, I figured 
I'd do it and learn a couple of things along the way. So after figuring out how to get jekyll to work with my site after the first lecture I went back to look at some of the 
other things required for this class. I was pretty bummed to find out that the textbook that the professor uses is the most expensive one this semester. On Friday 
professor Downing started introducing c++ since he's going on the assumption that none of us have coded in c++, which I think is a pretty safe assumption. At least none 
of my friends in the class or I have coded in c++. I like the way that he got some sample code and had us infer what each line did. He also introduced assertions, testing, 
and coverage. The way he did that was by introducing a different concept in each example by building on the previous example. I thought that it was a very effective way of 
teaching the material. I prefer that over just talking about it without any real examples. The only complaint I have about the class so far is that we have to use this tophat 
online learning software. I would've preferred having us use iClickers since that's what most other CS classes have used and I already have the hardware for it, but I can 
understand why the professor might have gone with tophat. Tophat is a cheaper entry cost vs iClickers and it doesn't require having any hardware by the student that could 
potentially get lost or malfunction.

###Tip of the Week:
If you want to run your Jekyll blog not on the root of your site (e.g running it on yoursite.com/blog) test it locally with `jekyll serve` from the root folder of your git 
project, not from `your-project/blog` and make sure everything works before pushing it live.
