After such a hectic last week of school, it's finally over. I took the second and final test on Friday since I took the software engineering test on Thursday.
This second test was apparently the first time that the professor was trying out a new format for the test since we took it on Canvas. I like that more than a
paper test since it's easier to write code in that format. Code isn't like writing sentences where you have to only make minimal edits. Writing code requires a
lot of moving words and symbols around to fit your solution. Therefore, typing it out on the computer as it is meant to be is a better format for a test. Overall
I think that the class had a good amount to learn from. Professor Downing teaches through coding. While some may like that, I personally would have preffered a
class that talks about the concepts of oop more than tying it to a specific language like c++. I wouldn't recommend this class if you don't like to stare at
code on a projector for 50 minutes. I would recommend this class if you want to learn the intricacies of c++. Finally, I think since this is a pretty programming
intensive class I wouldn't take it with something like 429, 439, or something else that would also take up a lot of time. If you do, you will end up with little
time for you other classes that you may take.

###Tip of the week:
When writing code into a text entry box on Canvas, you should select the `preformatted text` styling for the code, that way it is easier to type and read `since
it will look like this`
