Our group was able to finish the last phase of the our marvel project on time! Such a great feeling to have that done. Now we will all be able to put something
on our resumes that we can actually show to potential employers. I really loved this software engineering class. Even though I already knew much about web
application frameworks because of work, I still think I got a lot out of this class. I learned how to work with a bigger team than I am used to. I learned
how to lead a project (which I really enjoyed! Project lead/manager might be something for me to look into for the future). I learned how to design creative
solutions to difficult problems when I'm on a deadline. Usually for work, deadlines aren't something that I face since a lot of the projects I work on are
backlog projects that don't need to be completed before a specific time frame. If I hadn't come in to this class without knowledge of web application frameworks,
I'm not sure that would have done so well with the projects. Downing didn't really dive in speficially to the tools and the things we needed to know to get our
websites running. I feel like the lectures were more geared toward learning more of Python and some oop concepts to be able to get through technical interviews.
I'm not sure if my teammates or other classmates that didn't have web application framework experience feel that way about the lectures. Either way though, I'm
sure they also got a lot out of this class. There is no blog entry for Thanksgiving weekend, so I will see you all the week after! Have a Happy Thanksgiving! :)

###Tip of the week:
If you want to write a small, simple Python app that you will need to ocassionally access over the internet, Heroku is a great place to host your project! The
free tier plan is more than enough necessary if you will be the only one accessing it.
