So sorry, I totally forgot about my blog with everything that has been going along recently. So, two weeks my software engineering group
was able to get a lot of the groundwork done for the database website. This is because I had done this type of work at my job before, so
it was easy for my to get them goin really quickly. We were able to finish all of the requirements for the first phase of the database
website project. Honestly, the hardest part about it was trying to fulfill the word count requirement for the repository's wiki. We really
didn't have that much to say since most of the stuff we did so far was just customizations of most of the standard documentation available
for flask and the other technologies we are using anyways. The second most challenging problem was trying to design how the database will
be laid out to work with our implementation of how we are retrieving the information from the marvel api. With the help of everyone
though, we were able to cram 2,500 words into our repository's wiki to meet the word count requirement. That was a great feeling. Also
being the project leader of this phase was pretty fun in my opinion, I was able to see the strengths and weaknesses of my partners and
was able to assign appropriate roles and issues for them to suit their skills. I am looking forward towards completing the next two phases
of this project.

###Tip of the Week:
raspberry pis can take pictures with any type of webcam, not just the one designed for raspberry pi. if you want to set up a simple
webcam website, you should check out my implementation of my puppy cam [here](https://github.com/shibehacker/shibehacker.github.io)
