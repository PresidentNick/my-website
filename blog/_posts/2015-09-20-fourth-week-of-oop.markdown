This week in class, Professor Downing talked more about pointers and addresses and how they work in c++. This was a little hard
for me to follow since I'm not that experienced in a lower level language like c++. I'm also not seeing how I can use this 
knowledge in the Australian Voting problem that we have due next week. I think I'll see how it will be useful once I write more 
of the code for that project. Talking about the project, this is the first oop project I can work with a partner. So I partnered 
up with [Laura Artiles](http://lauraartiles.com/). I've worked with her before in operating systems class for 3 of the projects. 
So we've been through rought times in coding. I work well with her so I think we'll get a lot accomplished in this Australian 
Voting project. So far, we've gotten our IO taken care of, we still need to implement a simple solution. I think we can get that 
going sometime tomorrow. We have an idea of how we're going to implement it too. I really need to get a better grip on c++ since 
I've worked with Python a lot more and solving problems in Python is a lot easier for me just because I've done all my work 
projects in Python for the past year. Also, tomorrow is career fair. Professor Downing has talked a lot about it and highly 
emphasizes going to it. I'll print some resumes out tomorrow. I'm hoping it'll go well. I already have a really good job and it can only get better from here.

###Tip of the Week:
See if your router supports [openwrt](https://openwrt.org/). It pratically turns your router into a linux machine and adds a whole 
bunch of cool functionality to it! This weekend I put an program that tracks connections to my router and graphs the data to 
a webpage. I didn't actually write it myself, [this](https://github.com/phiresky/nmap-log-parse) is the author. It was a fun 
little project to get running on my router. Now I can see these graphs whenever I want!
