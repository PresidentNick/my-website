Barbara and I weren't able to write a fully functional Life project this week :( We were missing the iterators since we weren't sure how to iterate with a 2D
vector. I'm sure we'll at least get partial credit though for what we did complete. I can't believe it's finally over. All the projects I've been working on
that took up all my time during the semester will no longer be stressing me out. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with all my free time. Well I am sure
academically. I still need to prepare for the oop and swe exam. The oop one is the one I'm more nervous about since some of the concepts in the second half of
the semester weren't as easy for me to grasp. I also need to complete and ethnography project for my Latin American music class, which I'm taking for my
foreign language and vapa requirement. I really want the semester to be over though, but at least I get a little break next week for Thanksgiving which I'll
be spending in Miami visiting my dad and my brother. I'm glad I've taken this course and I'm looking forward to applying the concepts I learned to my job
in the real world. Downing is a great teacher and that will reflect in my eCIS survey (which I also get extra credit for!). There is no blog entry for Thanksgiving
weekend, so I will see you all the week after! Have a Happy Thanksgiving! :)

###Tip of the week:
If you want to write a small, simple Python app that you will need to ocassionally access over the internet, Heroku is a great place to host your project! The
free tier plan is more than enough necessary if you will be the only one accessing it.
