Once again, I am a late for the blog entry for this week. I had a backlog of blog entries to write. I think I have a pretty justifiable
reason to have forgotten about it though. I got a new miniature australian sheperd puppy last Sunday! So my fiance and I have been taking
care of him for a week already. We named him Tony. So Tony has been taking away most of my free time recently, but I just made a dedicated
effort to write about this past week of object oriented programming class in my blog. So this past week, we got our grades back for
project 3, the allocator project that Kaivan and I partnered up for. We did pretty weel considering that we had to turn it in a day late
for forgetting to add the graders to the project. Without the 20% penalty to our project we actually would have gotten a really good
score, only missing just a few points. So that made me feel pretty good. In class, I've seen less and less people show up. I'm not sure if
it's because there are people skipping class to study for their other classes or because people are q-dropping the class after receiving
their latest grades. Hopefully it's because of the former. This is definitely one of the more challenging classes that I've taken in my
undergraduate computer science career here at UT. I definitely think it will be very worth it in the long run though. Just gotta hang in
there, it's almost done!

###Tip of the Week:
set a calendar reminder on google calendar to do your blog posts on Sunday, that way you won't forget about them
