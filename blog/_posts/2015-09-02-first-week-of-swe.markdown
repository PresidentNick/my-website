So I totally forgot that I had put myself on the waitlist for this class back in the spring semester. I got a surprising email on Monday that I got off the waitlist for software engineering. After posting 
a question on the the oop piazza about taking oop and swe at the same time and asking a couple of my friends that have taken them how it was like, I decided to keep the class. Hopefully I made the right choice 
considering myself and how I can handle large workloads. Unfortunately I got the email on Monday after the class had already taken place. So today, Wednesday, was the first day of class in swe for me. This class 
is right after oop, and I realized that the first project in swe is practically the same as the first project in oop, just in a difference language. I'm pretty sure profesor Downing is just doing that do get 
students accustomed to the software development tool chain. I'm guessing that the next projects in class won't be as similar. Although for this first one, most of the work will already be done for me since 
I'm doing the same thing in oop. Just as in oop, professor Downing is meticulous in his lecture, and he calls out on students frequently.

###Tip of the Week:
Don't forget what waitlists you were on from the previous semester. Go to the class you are on the waitlist for just in case you get off the waitlist, that way you don't miss any of the first lectures.
