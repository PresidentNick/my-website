This week in class, Professor Downing taught us about some topics that left me with some confusion about c++ as well as about the class itself. We wrote a range class on Monday and on 
Wednesday he explained the ins and outs of consts in c++. So far in class, at least to me, it seems that we've just been talking about the c++ language itself. I do see the value in 
some of the topics he has talked about like requiring the weakest container needed to write your function so that it can work with the most containers possible. I can see how important 
that can be when trying to write generic code that will work in several situations. For the most part though, I feel like this class has mostly been talking about the details of c++ the 
language, not the concepts in object oriented programming. Maybe it could just be me thought, I may not be making all the connections from the class to what we're supposed to be learning. 
I talked to my friend though about it, and she feels the same way about the class. On Friday I took the oop test. I practiced all day for it by writing functions in c++. I think I did 
pretty well at writing the 4 functions. I know I didn't do as well when writing classes, since I didn't practice that as much. Now it's just a waiting game to see what grade I got on the 
exam.

###Tip of the Week:
A raspberry pi can make a super cheap personal cloud or personal VPN to your own network, even a light server for your website. [This](http://readwrite.com/2014/06/27/raspberry-pi-web-server-website-hosting) page shows a pretty good explanation on how to use your pi to host.
